The male cheek and flank marks are nearly the same color as the normal, but are slightly diluted. Males will often have a buff colored belly and some standards consider this a fault, preferring a white underside, while other standards call for it. All markings normally black will be changed to a dark, chocolate brown. The base gray color changes to the light brown. There is some variation in the depth of that color.\r\n\r\nFemale: Like the male, the base color is changed to a light brown or fawn color. Tear mark and tail markings are dark brown. The belly will be buff like the normal if not more so.\r\n\r\nFledglings: Fawn chicks will have light colored skin in the nest compared to the dark, near black of the normals. The beak will be horn-colored. As soon as the feathers are visible, the fawn coloring can be seen.
