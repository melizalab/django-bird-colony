    In principle, it would be best to do this by using the database to
    generate a summary for day 0, then march through the subsequent days and
    use new events to generate new summaries. However, in practice it's not
    trivial to update this structure, so we're taking the lazy but probably
    more inefficient route of querying the database for each day. Consider
    the other option if it becomes too slow.
